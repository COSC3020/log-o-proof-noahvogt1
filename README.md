I overheard gage my classmate talking about using change of base. I am not sure if I will use it in this but it seems like it could be useful.

In the lectures, we said that logarithms with different bases don't affect the
asymptotic complexity of an algorithm. Prove that $O(\log_{2} n)$ is the same as
$O(\log_{5} n)$. Use the mathematical definition of $O$ -- do a formal proof,
not just the intuition.

I have started with the formal definition of $O$ below. Add your answer to this
markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$T(n) \in O(f(n)) \iff \exists c, n_0: T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n) \forall n \geq n_0$
